# Alien-Raiders
A tribute to Space Invaders
To play use arrows to move, space bar to fire or better yet connect a game pad.
I wrote the project in ANSI C using nothing but a text editor and a C compiler.
You can also download the binaries from itch.io and search for Alien Raiders.
You can do whatever you want with this code, hopefully it will serve as an educational tool to people looking to learn
about game development.
For any issues or questions you can send me an email at eventhorizon02@gmail.com
Happy retro gaming!
